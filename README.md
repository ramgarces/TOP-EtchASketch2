# TOP-EtchASketch2

Etch-A-Sketch portfolio project from The Odin Project JavaScript curriculum.

The last time I did this project was over a year ago and it did not go nearly as well as it did this time. I think that I was hurting myself the last time that I did this project because I did not take the time to write down what I needed to do an break it down into smaller problems. This time, however, I did that and I feel like I was able to make it through the project with more ease. There were still instances where I ran into roadblocks, like last time, but last time I would get overwhelmed with my thoughts and would just look at other code to copy the answer. This time, I was able to break down the problems I needed to solve, asked myself how to solve them, and try to find guidance instead of just finding the answer without trying.
